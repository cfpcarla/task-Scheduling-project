# task-Scheduling-project

- Project is a Dispatche/ Driver Task Scheduling App. The idea is a single dispatcher can manage the tasks of multiple drivers.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- React with materialUI and alasq.

```
1. Code is in App.js
2. Npm install
3. Run the server: `npm start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`
```

### Improvements

- I think there is a lot of repetition in the code, I find it interesting to have more, but not in excess.
- To do more validations such as Location, the user can put any information that is saved in the data In which case it should only be the location of cities and not anything.
- When I open the add new task the driver name should be selected.

### Challenges

- I spent a lot of time trying to solve a part of the task that appears on the screen at the correct start and end time.
  A single conclusion that I was able to reach in that time was to execute a task of only 1 hour. I apologize because I know I did what was not requested, with a little more time I can make it appear for all hours.

- As I spent a lot of time trying to make the task appear, I didn't have time to execute the delete and apdate button on the screen and also download the schedule.
  I had a great learning experience with this project and I believe that with a little more time I would finish and I already appreciate the opportunity to be part of this project. Thank you!
